In the [Editor tab](/editor), the right side Contextual sidebar provides a simple animation editor. At any time a frame can be added to take a snapshot of the current settings from the left side Settings sidebar. Most settings are animatable, including continuous settins like Variation Axes, font size and color, as well as discrete settings like OpenType features. Currently a few settings remain unanimated: text align and text case transform.
